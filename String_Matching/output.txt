Lexical changes are those which could, in principle, be performed by a sophisticated
text editor. They do not require knowledge of the language sufficient
to parse a program. Typical approaches are e.g. rewording, adding or removing
comments; changing the formatting; and modifying identifier names.
A structural change requires the sort of knowledge of a program that would
be necessary to parse it. It is highly language-dependent. Some examples are
replacing loops (e.g. while..do to repeat..until or to for or vice versa);
